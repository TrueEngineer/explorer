# Explorer
Explorer is the set of Minecraftian computers in this repository. These computers are available with RAM, GPU, CPU, and other functionality to accommodate the inputs given by a user, and generate an output, which is the main idea of all computers. These computers will vary in specifications as new generations are created.

World downloads are available in /worlddl/.

## ExplorerScript
ExplorerScript is an independent scripting language to write Explorer programs to run in-game. Schematics are generated from the set of binary characters produced by the compiler (The script is compiled to binary). This binary is transferred to a schematic using **mcschematic**, a package to create .schem files containing your required binary.

Explorer 1 is in progress.
Currently in version 0.0.1.
